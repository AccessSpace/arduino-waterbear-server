arduino-waterbear-server
========================

A simple php5 site to allow Waterbear to program Arduino's in a workshop environment.

This project is redundant as https://github.com/waterbearlang/waterbear/tree/131-simple-robot now includes codebender.cc integration.
This uses a hosted webased compiler and a firefox plugin to directly upload the compiled code to the Arduino.
